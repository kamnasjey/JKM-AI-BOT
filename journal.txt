JKM-AI-BOT — Operator Journal

CURRENT STATUS (what works / what doesn’t)
- Massive provider: working (EURUSD m5 backfill writes candles; strict ticker mapping in provider).
- Persistence: working (state/marketdata/<SYMBOL>/m5.csv.gz + meta grow; meta.last_ts advances).
- Engine endpoints: working locally (status/manual-scan previously verified OK).
- Not yet fully verified in this pass: Phase B (15 symbols × 30d) and Phase C (15 symbols × 2y chunk/resume).

ENV/PORTS
- Backend listens on 127.0.0.1:8000 (docker compose backend).
- DATA_PROVIDER expected: massive (set in .env).
- DEBUG_INGEST expected: 1 (temporary, for proof logs).

LAST VERIFIED
- /health OK and reports provider configured (no secrets).
- Recent backend logs: no ERROR/TRACEBACK found in last tail.

NEXT STEP
- Collect 3+ INGEST_DEBUG evidence lines, then run Phase B (15 symbols × 30 days) backfill proof.

RULES
- ALWAYS start by reading and updating this journal.
- NEVER print or write any secrets (API keys, OAuth secrets, tokens). Only write PRESENT/MISSING or masked.
- Work on ONE repo only: /opt/JKM-AI-BOT.
- Proof-first: after changes, run smoke test and capture evidence lines.
- Avoid risky migrations for v0.1 (do not change persisted data format unless explicitly required).

GOAL (v0.1 Massive-only, VPS backend)
- Massive candle fetch works
- Persistence works (state/marketdata grows)
- 15 symbols backfill 2 years works (chunk + resume)
- Engine endpoints status/start/stop/manual-scan work

WATCHLIST (15 internal symbols)
EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, NZDUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY, EURGBP, AUDJPY, EURAUD, EURCHF, XAUUSD, BTCUSD

MASSIVE TICKER MAPPING (inside provider only)
- FX + Gold: massiveTicker = "C:" + internalSymbol
- Crypto: massiveTicker = "X:" + internalSymbol

[2026-01-09 16:03 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Initialized journal.txt per ops rules.
NOW:
- Preparing Massive-only proof run (build → backfill → persistence → logs → engine endpoints).
NEXT:
- Enforce .env flags (DATA_PROVIDER=massive, DEBUG_INGEST=1) without revealing secrets.
IDEAS:
- Keep all evidence logs secret-free; only report PRESENT/MISSING for keys.

[2026-01-09 16:04 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Upserted .env flags: DATA_PROVIDER=massive, DEBUG_INGEST=1 (no secrets printed).
NOW:
- Ready to validate Massive watchlist config.
NEXT:
- Verify config/massive_symbols.json is exactly the required 15-symbol list.
IDEAS:
- Keep DEBUG_INGEST=1 temporarily for proof, then disable after verification.

[2026-01-09 16:06 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Verified config/massive_symbols.json matches the required 15-symbol list.
NOW:
- Proceeding to smoke proof run (rebuild + EURUSD backfill + persistence + logs + engine manual-scan).
NEXT:
- Run docker compose rebuild and EURUSD backfill (7 days, m5, chunk-days=7) and capture proof lines.
IDEAS:
- Use docker logs grep INGEST_DEBUG for evidence fields (provider/internalSymbol/massiveTicker/tf/candles/persist/ms).

[2026-01-09 16:10 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Rebuilt backend container: docker compose up -d --build (container recreated).
- Smoke proof: Massive fetch + persistence + evidence logs + engine endpoints.
- Evidence (no secrets):
	- INGEST_DEBUG admin_backfill_chunk: provider=MASSIVE internalSymbol=EURUSD massiveTicker=C:EURUSD tf=m5 candles=60 persist=state/marketdata/EURUSD/m5.csv.gz ms~702
	- Persistence grew: state/marketdata/EURUSD/m5.csv.gz size 4.0K → 4.2K; meta.rows_count 366 → 372; meta.last_ts advanced.
	- Engine endpoint: POST /api/engine/manual-scan returned ok:true with last_scan_id present.
NOW:
- Proof artifacts are present under state/marketdata and in docker logs.
NEXT:
- Create git commit and push to remote.
IDEAS:
- Backfill script writes 0 rows if the requested window is already covered; admin backfill can still append newest candles for proof.

[2026-01-09 17:06 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Created git commit and pushed to remote branch (no secrets).
NOW:
- Starting end-to-end v0.1 Massive-only proof pass (sanity checks → backfills → engine endpoints).
NEXT:
- Step A sanity checks: docker running, /health, env presence (PRESENT/MISSING), provider=massive, 15-symbol config.
IDEAS:
- If EURUSD 7-day chunk backfill writes 0 due to overlap, adjust Massive fetch to include latest candles (still no format change).

[2026-01-09 17:16 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Sanity: docker compose backend running; /health OK.
- Fixed /health to treat MASSIVE_BASE_URL as optional default (provider_configured now true when MASSIVE_API_KEY is present).
- Fixed Massive aggregates fetch to use newest-first (sort=desc) so incremental backfills append rows.
- Phase A proof (EURUSD 7d, m5, chunk=7): backfill_chunk wrote 240 candles; state/marketdata/EURUSD/m5.csv.gz grew 4.2K → 6.2K; meta.rows_count 372 → 612; meta.last_ts advanced.
NOW:
- Ready to proceed Phase A log collection and Phase B (15 symbols × 30d) backfill.
NEXT:
- Commit and push the latest fixes to GitHub.
IDEAS:
- Keep using INGEST_DEBUG evidence lines; still no secrets.

[2026-01-09 17:25 Asia/Ulaanbaatar] (checkpoint)
DONE:
- Added a top-of-file CURRENT STATUS section for fast operator context.
NOW:
- Pushing journal-only update to GitHub.
NEXT:
- Continue proof run: collect 3+ INGEST_DEBUG lines and start Phase B (15 symbols × 30d).
IDEAS:
- Keep journal updates small and checkpointed; no secrets.
